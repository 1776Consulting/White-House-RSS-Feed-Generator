The [White House Blog] [RSS feed] appears to be updated very sporadically: not
all new content published on the "blog" makes it into the RSS feed.

This is a silly hack to create an RSS feed by scraping the White House blog
website. It is updated every hour and published [here].

The main impetus for doing this was to make sure that [whitehouse_diff]
continues to work.
