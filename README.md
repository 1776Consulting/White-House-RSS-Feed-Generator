The [White House Website] is currently a WordPress site but the RSS feed appears to be disabled. whrss.py generates an  RSS feed by scraping the White House blog website. I run it every 30 minutes and publish it at [https://inkdroid.org/rss/whitehouse.xml](https://inkdroid.org/rss/whitehouse.xml).

The main impetus for doing this was to use [diffengine] to publish [whitehouse_diff]. But maybe you'll find the RSS useful for other things too?
